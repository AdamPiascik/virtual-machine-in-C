/*  This program implements a virtual machine to run programs stored as arrays
    in "programs.c". The desired program is selected by loading it into the
    start of the stack; these blocks are essentially read-only for the rest of
    the program, and only blocks from (last instruction + 1) upwards are
    written to. Instructions are loaded sequentially into R0 where they are executed
    and the result pushed to the top of the stack. */
